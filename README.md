my name is gregório, but u can call me whatever tf u want.
im a brazilian 13 yr old who likes to listen to old shit and thinks that listenin to old songs makes me even more "cool" or however u call it.
i make noises, bcuz its rlly hard for me to call it "music". im interested in many shit.
if u want to do any collabs or anything else, just go for it.
